# Known Issues

Observations that warrant future investigation.  Not necessarily bugs —
sometimes just suspicious correlations we don't yet fully understand.

## Tmux layout change correlates with input failures

**Observation:**
During a long CEO session with Copilot (pane label `e2e-test`), `tmux
send-keys` began silently dropping keys after the user changed the tmux
layout (pane 1 went from roughly `224x56` to `224x32`).  Before the
layout change, `ceo-select` / `ceo-approve` worked reliably.  After the
layout change — correlated with a batch of hung background sub-agents in
Copilot — input was accepted by tmux but never consumed by Copilot's Ink
event loop.

**Partial fix already landed:**
The immediate symptom (key-name `Enter` being dropped) was traced to
tmux's key-name translation layer interacting badly with Copilot's Ink
stdin polling in a reduced state.  `send_keys()` now routes known keys
(`Enter`, arrows, `Ctrl-*`, etc.) through `tmux send-keys -H <hex>`,
which reliably reaches Copilot's stdin.  See commit that added
`_KEY_TO_HEX` in `transport.py`.

**What's still unclear:**
Whether the layout change itself is a cause or just a coincidence.
Theories to investigate:

1. Pane resize sends `SIGWINCH` to Copilot, which triggers an Ink
   re-render.  During re-render, the stdin listener may be temporarily
   detached.  Keys sent *during* that window could be dropped.
2. A smaller pane may cause Copilot's dialog box (especially permission
   dialogs containing long shell commands) to be clipped, which changes
   which component owns the active input focus inside Ink.
3. Ink's internal `useInput` hooks may be gated on pane dimensions; a
   too-small pane could disable input components silently.
4. The tmux history (`scrollback`) handling may differ for smaller panes
   and cause `capture-pane -p` to return stale content, leading our
   verification logic to believe a key was not consumed when it actually
   was (or vice-versa).

**Reproduction suggestion:**
1. Start Copilot in a `224x56` pane, put it into an ask-user dialog
2. Confirm `duo ceo-select <task> 1` works
3. Resize the pane to `224x20` or similar
4. Retry the same `ceo-select` call — does it still work?
5. Try with raw byte path (already in `send_keys`) vs. key-name path
   (by temporarily reverting the `_KEY_TO_HEX` lookup)

**Suggested fix direction:**
- Add a `tmux resize-pane` auto-recovery in `ceo-*` commands: if input
  verification (`send_keys_verified`) returns `False`, automatically
  resize the pane to at least `N` columns × `M` rows, retry once, then
  fail loudly with a clear recovery hint.
- Alternatively, document a minimum pane size in
  `docs/ceo-workflow.md` and fail fast in `duo doctor` if the target
  pane is smaller than that minimum.

**Priority:** Medium.  Current mitigation (hex-byte path) is working in
practice, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood and may
cause regressions under similar conditions.

**First observed:** During the CEO session around the "big-dialog detection"
and "parallel sub-agents" failures (see commit `dab818f` onwards).
